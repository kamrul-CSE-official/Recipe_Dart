## 🚀 Suggested Learning Steps

### 🧩 Step 1: Understand Dart OOP Basics
- Constructors and their types  
- Class fields and methods  
- Object instantiation and usage  

### ⚙️ Step 2: Practice Real-World Scenarios

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Mental Bridge Building:** Every time you encounter these in Flutter:
| Flutter Concept | OOP Equivalent | Meaning |
|------------------|----------------|----------|
| `class` | Blueprint | Defines structure of objects |
| `constructor` | Object initializer | Creates instance of class |
| `.obs` | Reactive property | Enables automatic UI updates |
